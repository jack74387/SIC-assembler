  The previous exercise just normalizs the input assembly program.
  Its output is easy to parse for the pass 1.

  This exercise reads the output of the previous program through stdin 
  and writes the output to two files, INTFILE and SYMTAB.
  Note: The filenames are in uppercase, exactly as shown above.
        They are NEITHER "INTFILE.txt" nor "SYMTAB.txt".

  Your program should be named exer4.cpp, exer4.cc or exer4.c.
  
  $ g++ exer4.cpp               # compiling your program 
  $ mv a.out your-pass1         # the executable is renamed as 'your-pass1'
  
  The INTFILE is the intermediate file which format is like the input except
  the loc is inserted at the beginning of each line.
  The SYMTAB is the symbol table. Its first line contains the 
  program name, starting address, and program length where the last two items
  are written in hexdecimal. Its following lines show the content of 
  the symbol table. Note the order of symbol in the symtable does not need to
  follow the order the symbol appeared in the input file.

  For example, assuming that the input assembly is sictest.asm,
  the scenario is just like:

  $ cat sictest.asm | ./your-split-prog | ./your-pass1
  
  Then two files named INTFILE and SYMTAB should be created.

  I have put SAMPLE files in your directory. Check them for format. 

  If you do not have workable splitting program, you can still
  test your pass 1 with SAMPLE split files as follows.

  $ cat SAMPLE-split-1 | ./your-pass1
  $ cat SAMPLE-split-2 | ./your-pass1
  $ cat SAMPLE-split-3 | ./your-pass1

  NOTE: 
   Your INTFILEs should be the same with the sample intermediate files.
   But for SYMTAB, only the first line should be the same. Other lines 
   may be in different order. To help you test the output, I have written
   a program to sort the lines. 

   That is: 
   For SAMPLE-split-1, 
     your INTFILE should be the same as SAMPLE-INTFILE-1 and 
     your SYMTAB after sorted should be the same as SAMPLE-SYMTAB-1.
   For SAMPLE-split-2, 
     your INTFILE should be the same as SAMPLE-INTFILE-2 and
     your SYMTAB after sorted should be the same as SAMPLE-SYMTAB-2.
   For SAMPLE-split-3, 
     your INTFILE should be the same as SAMPLE-INTFILE-3 and
     your SYMTAB after sorted should be the same as SAMPLE-SYMTAB-3.

   For example, using SAMPLE-split-2 for input, you can check your output
   as follows.

   $ cat SAMPLE-split-2 | ./your-pass1   # INTFILE and SYMTAB generated

   # Compare with sample INTFILE. This should output nothing.
   $ diff INTFILE SAMPLE-INTFILE-2       

   # Sort and compare with the sample SYMTAB. This should output nothing.
   $ ./sort-sym SYMTAB | diff - SAMPLE-SYMTAB-2
